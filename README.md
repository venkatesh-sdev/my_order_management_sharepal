<!-- Design and create a responsive "My Orders" section for Sharepal using ReactJS and mockup Data.

1. Users should be able to see a list of their past orders with order_id, order_date,delivery_date, pickup_date, total_order_amount, and stage of the order.

2. Each order goes through 10+ stages like Order Received, KYC Received, Order Confirmed, Order Packed, Order Delivered, Pickup Due, Pickup Scheduled, Quality Checked, etc in sequential order. Try to design a UI where a user can see the current stage of the order with clear distinction on completed stages and next stages for the order.
